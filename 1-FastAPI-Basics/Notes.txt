FastAPI Framework:

1. FastAPI is a high performace Python Framework for Web Development. It is used to develop APIs (RESTfull applications).
2. It is intuitive and easy to learn. The APIs can also be developed faster.
3. It offers features like:
    a. Schema Validation (using pydantic)
    b. Async
    c. Automatic REST API documentation etc. [Eg. http://localhost:8000/docs]
4. It uses uvicorn webserver for serving the requests. 
    uvicorn uses ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) to run the asynchronous code in python.

============================

To run the application, use the following command:
> uvicorn <package_name>.<app_name>:app

Eg. uvicorn pack.main:app

For debugging, use:
> uvicorn <app_name>:app -- reload
